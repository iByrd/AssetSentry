    <h4>Effective Date: April 7, 2025</h4>
    Asset Sentry is a web-based asset management tool designed to help universities manage equipment loans, such as laptops and multimedia devices. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect information within the application.
    <h4>1. Information We Collect</h4>
    We collect the following types of information strictly for loan and inventory management:
    <h5>User-Provided Information</h5>
    When a staff member or administrator creates or updates a loan, they may provide:
    <ul>
        <li>Student name</li>
        <li>
            Contact email
        </li>
        <li>
            Loan details (item borrowed, loan date, due date)
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>System-Generated Information</h4>
    The system also records:
    <ul>
        <li>
            Loan ID
        <li>
            Equipment status (available, loaned, overdue)
        </li>
        <li>
            Timestamped actions for audit purposes
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>
        2. How We Use Information</h4>
    We use the collected data to:
    <ul>
        <li>
    Track active and historical loans</li>
        <li>
            Monitor equipment availability and status</li>
        <li>
            Send email reminders about upcoming due dates or overdue items</li>
        <li>
            Maintain accurate inventory records</li>
            </ul>
    We do not use this information for advertising or analytics beyond performance tracking within the system.
    <h4>
        3. Data Access and Security</h4>
    <h5>Role-Based Access</h5>
    Only authorized users (e.g., IT staff, library personnel) can access and manage the data relevant to their role.
    <h5>User Authentication</h5>
    Access to the system requires valid login credentials.
    While the system includes standard safeguards to protect data, it does not currently incorporate advanced encryption.
    <h4>
        4. Data Sharing</h4>
    Asset Sentry does not share personal or institutional data with third parties. All data remains under the control of the university or organization using the system.
    <h4>
        5. Student Info Requests</h4>
    If a student wants to see or correct their loan info, staff can review and make updates in the system.
    <h4>
        6. Changes to This Policy</h4>
    This Privacy Policy may be updated as the software evolves. Partner universities will be notified of significant updates, and changes will also be reflected in the system documentation.
    <h4>
        7. Contact</h4>
    For questions or concerns about this policy, please contact the project team at assetsentry@mail.com (email not setup yet).
